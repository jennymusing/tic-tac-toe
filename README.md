# tic-tac-toe

Make a command line tic-tac-toe game from scratch for two players. 

Create a basic 3x3 board object in Javascript that lists the current item in each space on the board (e.g. "X", "O", or " "). Create a render() function which cycles through that board object and creates the appropriate HTML elements. Style them to look like a real tic-tac-toe board.
